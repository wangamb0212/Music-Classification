# Music-Classification

<h2>Description</h2>

Spotify released an API that reports the audio features of its songs, such as "tempo" or "energy". I used PCA and t-SNE for dimension reduction. Then, I used Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification for classifying the songs. Guess whose songs, on average, are the loudest? YAHHH, SVDDEN DEATH!<br />
